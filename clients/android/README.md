# AniLingo Android clients

This directory contains the first-party Android phone and Android TV clients defined by [`docs/ANDROID_CLIENTS.md`](../../docs/ANDROID_CLIENTS.md).

## Modules

- `app-mobile`: phone shell; the full AniLingo web UI remains the normal Library/Learn/Settings surface, while episode playback becomes native.
- `app-tv`: native TV shell and player surface.
- `core-api`: versioned `/api/client/v1` route/compatibility contract.
- `core-model`: shared immutable client models.
- `core-player`: Media3 player/session foundation and deterministic direct/fallback selection.
- `core-session`: shared playback-session/companion command models for the later pairing slice.
- `core-design`: packages the canonical JSON under `design/player` as Android assets. Those JSON files remain the source of truth.

## Baseline

- AGP 9.4.0
- Gradle 9.6.0
- JDK 17
- Kotlin/Compose compiler 2.4.20
- compileSdk 36
- targetSdk 36
- minSdk 26
- Media3 1.11.1
- Compose BOM 2026.09.00
- TV Material 1.1.0

The repository CI installs Gradle 9.6 directly and builds both debug APKs. Release signing is intentionally not enabled in this foundation slice; release APK signing remains a later #69 step using protected GitHub secrets.

## Build

From this directory with Android SDK 36 available:

```bash
gradle :core-api:testDebugUnitTest :core-player:testDebugUnitTest
gradle :app-mobile:assembleDebug :app-tv:assembleDebug
```

The shared models/routes mirror the current server `/api/client/v1` contract, including profile-scoped playback progress and media-storage recovery/Wake-on-LAN capability state.

## Parallel app ownership

Phone and TV are intentionally developed in parallel after this foundation is merged:

- **Agent A / phone** owns `app-mobile/**`.
- **Agent B / TV** owns `app-tv/**`.
- `core-api/**`, `core-model/**`, `core-player/**`, `core-session/**`, `core-design/**`, Gradle root files, and `.github/workflows/android.yml` are shared infrastructure. An app agent must claim/coordinate a shared-path change before editing it.
- Neither app agent edits server/web paths as part of its app slice unless a separate non-overlapping claim is recorded.

This keeps phone and TV changes independently reviewable while both consume one server contract and one player model.
